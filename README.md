Installation
-------

 - Jupyter

    Installing Jupyter notebooks on any platform is pretty easy. Most people prefer to use the [anaconda distribution][3] which has been made available by Continuum Analytics. It comes pre loaded with many essential packages in addition to choice of python 2 or 3. 

    The  Anaconda website provides both command line and GUI installers for different platforms making it really comfortable for the user to install. Apart from that, since Jupyter is essentially open source and one can pull from their [github repository][4]. Typical time to install Jupyter and get it up and running will be typically under an hour even for a non technical person. Tech savvy people can accomplish the task in a matter of minutes.

 - Zeppelin

    On the other hand, installing zeppelin is not an easy job. It has a whole lot of things that need to be taken care of and is an extremely time consuming process as well. It requires maven and many other Java libraries in addition to setting up the OS properly. This is a hard task for someone who doesn't have the required technical know how and it can easily consume time in the order of a few hours.

The winner here is Jupyter.
